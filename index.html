    <h2>About the Project</h2>

    <p>
      Nowadays, the purchasing power of individuals is increasingly threatened by economic fluctuations and rampant inflation. Each person or family feels the pressing need to monitor their expenses and understand where every penny is spent.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this context, a recurring question often arises before each outing or meal: "How much will I spend on this family meal?" or "Will this exceed my monthly budget?". As trivial as these questions might seem, they represent the reality of many households.
    </p>

    <p>
      Faced with this reality, the idea for this project was born. We wanted to offer each user a reliable and practical tool, enabling them to estimate their expenses and manage their budget better. We firmly believe that technology, when used wisely, can provide solutions to concrete problems and positively impact our daily lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although this project was designed as part of my curriculum at Holberton School, it goes beyond a mere academic framework. It's the result of our passion for development and our desire to provide a concrete solution to a societal problem.
